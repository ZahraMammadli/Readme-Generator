    ##Description
    The Readme file is often the first file which the users read. It is a text file that contains the information for the user about the software, project, code, game, or it might contain instructions, help, or details about the patches or updates.  The readme file is used to explain what is uploaded and how we can install or use it. nodeA well-written readme file is more important if you intend to show these projects in your resume. This command line application allows you automatically create a readme file, reduce time and keep in well structured for all of your projects.
